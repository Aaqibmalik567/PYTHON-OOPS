Here's a revised version of the **Python OOPs assignment answers** in **slightly longer and clearer paragraphs**, providing more detail while still being concise:\n","\n","---\n","\n","1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n","   OOP is a programming approach based on the concept of “objects,” which are instances of classes that combine data and behavior. It allows developers to model real-world entities, promoting modularity, code reuse, and scalability. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n","\n","2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n","   A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype for creating objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that define the behavior of the objects. For example, a class `Car` may contain attributes like `color` and `speed`, and methods like `drive()` or `stop()`.\n","\n","3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n","   An object is an instance of a class, meaning it is a real implementation of the blueprint provided by the class. Each object can hold unique data and has the ability to use the class’s defined methods. For example, `car1 = Car()` creates an object of class `Car`.\n","\n","4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n","   Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features to the user. Encapsulation binds data and methods into a single unit and restricts access to some of the object’s components using access modifiers like private or protected. Both help in making code secure and manageable.\n","\n","5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n","   Dunder (double underscore) methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__add__` are special methods with double underscores before and after their names. They enable operator overloading and define how objects behave with built-in Python operations. For example, `__str__` returns a string representation of an object.\n","\n","6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP:**\n","   Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and methods of another class. The class that is inherited from is the parent (or base) class, and the new class is the child (or derived) class. This helps reuse existing code and create more specific subclasses.\n","\n","7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n","   Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object calling it. In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding in inherited classes or by using common interfaces with different implementations.\n","\n","8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n","   Encapsulation is achieved by defining private variables using a single or double underscore prefix (e.g., `_var`, `__var`) and providing methods (getters/setters) to access or modify them. This hides the internal state and restricts direct access from outside the class.\n","\n","9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n","   A constructor is a special method named `__init__()` in Python that is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the object’s attributes and can accept parameters to set initial values for those attributes.\n","\n","10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n","    A class method uses the `@classmethod` decorator and takes `cls` as the first argument, referring to the class itself. A static method uses the `@staticmethod` decorator and does not take `self` or `cls`. Class methods can access or modify class state, while static methods are utility functions.\n","\n","11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n","    Python does not support traditional method overloading directly like other languages, but it can be simulated using default parameters, `*args`, and `**kwargs` to accept varying numbers and types of arguments in a method.\n","\n","12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n","    Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. This allows the subclass to alter or enhance the base class behavior.\n","\n","13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n","    The `@property` decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute. It is used to define getter functions for attributes, often in combination with `@setter` and `@deleter` decorators to control access to private attributes.\n","\n","14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n","    Polymorphism provides flexibility and decoupling in the code. It allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, which makes the code extensible and easier to maintain.\n","\n","15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n","    An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be subclassed. It can contain one or more abstract methods (defined using the `abc` module), which must be implemented by any subclass.\n","\n","16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n","    OOP offers better code organization, reusability through inheritance, abstraction for simplifying complex problems, and encapsulation for protecting data. It leads to cleaner, modular, and easier-to-maintain codebases.\n","\n","17. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n","    A class variable is shared across all instances of the class, while an instance variable is unique to each object. Class variables are declared inside the class but outside any method; instance variables are typically defined in the constructor.\n","\n","18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n","    Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one parent class. Python supports it, and the method resolution order (MRO) determines which parent’s method is used if there's a conflict.\n","\n","19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python:**\n","    The `__str__()` method returns a user-friendly string representation of the object, used by `print()`. The `__repr__()` method returns an official string representation used for debugging and should ideally return a string that can recreate the object.\n","\n","20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n","    `super()` is used to call a method from a parent class, especially in method overriding. It allows for better code reuse and supports multiple inheritance by following Python’s method resolution order (MRO).\n","\n","21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n","    `__del__()` is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to perform cleanup actions such as releasing resources or closing files.\n","\n","22. **What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**\n","    `@staticmethod` defines a method that does not access the instance or class. `@classmethod` can modify class-level data and receives the class as an argument. Both are used for structuring utility functions within a class.\n","\n","23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n","    In inheritance, polymorphism allows child classes to override parent class methods. When a method is called on an object, Python determines the correct method to execute based on the object’s class, even when accessed via a base class reference.\n","\n","24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n","    Method chaining is a technique where methods return `self` so that multiple methods can be called on the same object in a single statement, improving code readability and conciseness.\n","\n","25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n","    The `__call__()` method allows an object to be used as a function. When defined, calling an instance like `obj()` will invoke `obj.__call__()`. This can be used to implement custom behavior or callable classes."],"metadata":{"id":"fuTlYwLl9KF6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
